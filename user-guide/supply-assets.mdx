Supplying earns variable interest and can provide collateral for borrowing. This guide covers the essentials without the fluff.

## How To Supply

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Dashboard">Choose an asset and click Supply.</Step>
  <Step title="Enter Amount">
    Review the preview (APY, impact). Approve if asked, then confirm.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Collateral Toggle">
    Enable collateral only if you plan to borrow against it.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Note: Some tokens require a one‑time approval before the first supply.

## Rates At A Glance

- Supply APY changes with utilization (supply/demand)
- Interest compounds automatically; no manual claiming needed
- See Interest Rates for the model and examples

## Collateral Basics

Enable collateral when you intend to borrow; disable it for simple yield with lower risk. Different assets have different LTVs and liquidation thresholds. Check the UI before borrowing.

## Withdrawing

You can withdraw anytime if there is liquidity in the pool. Large withdrawals are easier at lower utilization.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Asset">Click Withdraw on the asset.</Step>
  <Step title="Choose Amount">Enter an amount or use Max.</Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">
    Review the impact on your health factor if borrowing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Good Habits

- Don’t supply 100% of your holdings
- Keep some native tokens for fees
- Review positions periodically and adjust as rates change
