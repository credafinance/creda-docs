Focus on a few metrics, keep a buffer, and make small, timely adjustments.

## What To Watch

- Health factor: primary safety indicator (aim 1.5+)
- Utilization and rates: higher utilization → higher borrow/supply APYs
- Liquidity: large withdrawals are easier at lower utilization

## Common Actions

- Add collateral or repay to lift health factor
- Toggle collateral for assets you don’t need to borrow against
- Rebalance between assets if rates or risk change

## Simple Rhythm

- Daily: glance at health factor and major price moves
- Weekly: review rates and net interest; adjust if needed
- After big moves: top‑up or deleverage promptly rather than waiting

## Guardrails

- Don’t borrow to the max; leave room for volatility
- Keep native tokens for fees and an emergency top‑up fund
- Use alerts to get ahead of risky levels

Small, consistent maintenance beats infrequent, stressful overhauls.
