# Borrow Assets

Borrow without selling your collateral. Keep an eye on your health factor and give yourself a buffer for market moves.

## How To Borrow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Supply collateral">
    Deposit assets and enable them as collateral.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pick asset & amount">
    Compare borrow APYs. Enter an amount that keeps HF safely above 1.0 (aim for 1.5+).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">
    Review new HF and costs, then approve the transaction.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Rates And Risk

- Borrow APY is variable and rises with utilization
- Your health factor is: `(Σ collateral × threshold) / total debt`
- If HF < 1.0, your position can be liquidated

Simple rule: size loans so routine volatility won’t push HF near 1.0.

## Isolation & EMode

- Isolation: when using isolated collateral, you can only borrow whitelisted assets and within caps
- EMode: for correlated assets, group parameters allow higher LTV but require single‑group collateral

Check the UI for the exact rules that apply to your position.

## Good Habits

- Set alerts for HF levels (e.g., 1.6, 1.4, 1.2)
- Keep repayment or collateral top‑up funds ready
- Review rates and utilization; refinance or adjust when needed
