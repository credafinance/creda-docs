# Connect Your Wallet

Creda supports Keplr, Leap, and WalletConnect‑compatible wallets.

## Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open creda.finance">
    Click Connect Wallet.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose a wallet">
    Keplr or Leap (browser), or WalletConnect for mobile.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Approve prompts">
    Approve connection and add the Terra network if prompted.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Tip: Most wallets auto‑configure Terra when you approve the network.

## Troubleshooting

- Extension not detected: ensure it’s installed, unlocked, and up to date
- Network missing: add Terra (Phoenix‑1) when prompted
- Insufficient gas: keep a small LUNA balance for fees

Never share your seed phrase. Verify you are on the official site before approving.
