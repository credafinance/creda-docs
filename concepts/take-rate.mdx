Creda uses two mechanisms for protocol revenue: a take rate on supplied balances and a reserve factor from borrower interest.

## Take Rate (on supply)

- Dynamic annual fee applied to supplied balances, configured per asset via governance
- Can be configured as:
  - **Fixed rate**: Constant percentage (e.g., 2% yearly)
  - **Utilization-based curve**: Rate varies with market utilization
- Example: 2% yearly on 1,000 USDC → 20 USDC
- Each asset can have unique take rate parameters set by governance

## Reserve Factor (from borrow interest)

- Portion of borrower interest kept by protocol, configured per asset via governance
- Can be configured as:
  - **Fixed rate**: Constant percentage of borrow interest
  - **Utilization-based curve**: Rate increases with utilization (higher risk → higher protocol reserves)
- Supply APY ≈ Borrow APY × Utilization × (1 − Reserve Factor)
- Higher utilization can trigger higher reserve rates to protect the protocol during riskier market conditions

Combined impact determines your net supply yield. Check the market UI for each asset's parameters.
