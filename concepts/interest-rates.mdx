# Interest Rates

Rates on Creda are dynamic and driven by utilization: as more of an asset’s pool is borrowed, borrow rates rise to attract supply and encourage repayment; supply rates rise alongside.

## Core Ideas

- Utilization model: `utilization = borrowed / supplied`
- Rate curves: gentle at low utilization, steep near the top to protect liquidity
- Supply APY links to borrow APY: `supply ≈ borrow × utilization × (1 − reserve factor)`

Quick example:
```
At 80% utilization with 10% borrow APY and 15% reserve factor:
Supply APY ≈ 10% × 0.8 × 0.85 = 6.8%
```

## What To Watch

- Current utilization for assets you use
- Recent rate ranges (not single points)
- Protocol announcements that adjust parameters

## Practical Guidance

- Suppliers: diversify, avoid chasing spikes, and plan for variability
- Borrowers: budget for rate increases and keep health buffers
- Everyone: treat rates as changing bands; optimize without over‑trading
