Flash loans let advanced users borrow instantly without collateral and repay within the same transaction. If the loan plus fee isn’t repaid before the transaction ends, everything is canceled automatically.

## What You Can Do

- Execute arbitrage or liquidations
- Swap collateral or refinance positions quickly
- Move between markets without posting extra capital

## Basics To Know

- No collateral needed; repayment happens in the same transaction
- Supported assets and fees vary by market and liquidity
- If repayment fails, the transaction reverts (only gas is spent)

## Where To Find It

Most users won’t need flash loans; they’re mainly for bots, and integrations.
