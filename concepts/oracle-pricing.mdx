Creda relies on oracles to price assets, calculate borrowing power, and trigger liquidations. Prices come from multiple sources and are validated before use to keep positions fair and safe.

## What Oracles Do

- Provide on‑chain price data for each asset
- Drive key calculations: health factor, LTV limits, liquidation triggers
- Update frequently with guardrails to prevent bad data

## How We Source And Validate Prices

- Multiple feeds: decentralized oracle networks plus on‑chain DEX data where appropriate
- Aggregation: median/weighted methods and smoothing to reduce noise
- Validation: deviation limits, freshness checks, and circuit‑breaker logic for abnormal moves

This reduces manipulation risk and avoids cascading liquidations from a single bad feed.

## What It Means For You

- Collateral up, safer: Collateral price increases improve health factor and borrowing power
- Collateral down, riskier: Price drops reduce safety; monitor your health factor
- Borrowed asset up: Debt value rises in USD terms; health factor can fall

Plan for some oracle lag and smoothing during fast markets and set alerts on your positions.

## Special Cases

- Stablecoins: Extra monitoring to detect and react to depegs
- LP/derivative tokens: Prices derived from underlying assets and pool math
- Emerging assets: Stricter limits and/or isolation until sufficient data quality is proven

Understanding oracle behavior helps you interpret health factor changes and act early during volatility.
