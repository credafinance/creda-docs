DeFi lending carries real risks. Use conservative settings, monitor your health factor, and size positions so you can act under stress.

## Market & Rate Risk

- Price volatility: collateral can fall fast; keep buffers
- Correlation: multiple assets can drop together; diversify thoughtfully
- Interest rates: borrow costs can rise and supply yields can fall

## Liquidation Risk

If HF < 1.0, liquidators can repay part of your debt and take collateral at a discount. Avoid by keeping HF well above 1.0 (1.5+ recommended), setting alerts, and acting early.

## Smart Contract & Oracle Risk

- Code bugs or integration issues can cause loss
- Bad or delayed prices can affect HF unexpectedly
  Mitigate by limiting exposure, spreading risk, and staying informed about updates.

## Operational & Liquidity Risk

- Network congestion can delay urgent transactions
- Pool liquidity constraints can limit large withdrawals
  Plan for emergencies: keep fee tokens and an action plan ready.

This is not financial advice. Never risk more than you can afford to lose.
