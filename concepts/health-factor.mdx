Health factor (HF) is the live safety gauge for your position. Keep it well above 1.0 to avoid liquidation; aim for 1.5+ as a practical buffer.

## The Formula

```
HF = (Σ collateral value × liquidation threshold) / total debt
```

Interpretation:

- Higher collateral or thresholds → higher HF
- More debt or rising debt asset price → lower HF

Ranges:

- 2.0+: comfortable for most users
- ~1.5: manage actively; react to volatility
- ~1.2: risky; add collateral or repay soon
- \<1.0: can be liquidated

## What Moves HF

- Collateral down → HF down; collateral up → HF up
- Borrowed asset up → HF down (debt worth more in USD)
- Interest accrues on debt → HF drifts down over time

## Keeping It Safe

- Plan around a range, not a point; set alerts (e.g., 1.6/1.4/1.2)
- Add collateral, repay, or reduce exposure early when needed
- Check parameters shown in the UI for Isolation Mode or EMode

## LTV vs Health Factor

LTV sets how much you can borrow initially; HF tells you how safe you are right now.

LTV (Loan‑to‑Value):

- Per‑asset limit used to size the initial loan
- Example: 70% LTV → up to \$70 per \$100 collateral
- Protocol‑set; changes infrequently

HF (Health Factor):

- Live risk metric using liquidation thresholds
- `HF = (Σ collateral × threshold) / total debt`
- HF > 1.0 is safe; \< 1.0 can be liquidated

How to use them:

- When borrowing: use LTV to size initial borrow
- When monitoring: track HF as markets move
- Good practice: borrow well below max LTV and keep HF ≥ 1.5
