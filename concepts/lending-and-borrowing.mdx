# Lending and Borrowing

Creda Finance matches suppliers who earn interest with borrowers who post collateral. Rates adjust with supply and demand, and every loan is over‑collateralized to protect the system.

## Supplying

- Deposit assets to earn variable interest (compounds automatically)
- Enable as collateral if you plan to borrow
- Withdraw anytime, subject to pool liquidity

## Borrowing

- Borrow against enabled collateral within each asset’s LTV limits
- Maintain a safe health factor to avoid liquidation
- Interest on borrows accrues continuously

Key formulas:
```
Max Borrow = Collateral Value × LTV
Health Factor = (Collateral Value × Liquidation Threshold) / Total Debt
```

## Rates In Brief

- Utilization‑based: higher utilization → higher borrow and supply rates
- Piecewise curves: gentle increases at low utilization; steep at high
- Reserve factor: small portion of interest goes to the protocol

See Interest Rates for examples and deeper context.

## Practical Tips

- Keep buffers: avoid borrowing to the maximum
- Watch utilization when planning large withdrawals
- Use EMode for correlated assets; use Isolation Mode for riskier collateral

Start small, learn the flow, then increase size as you get comfortable.
