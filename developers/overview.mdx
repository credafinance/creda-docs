# Developer Overview

Creda is a modular Cosmos lending protocol: CosmWasm contracts on‑chain, an indexer + API off‑chain, and a React frontend.

## Architecture

- Contracts: portfolio (lending/borrowing), oracle, token proxies, global config
- Backend: indexer processes events → Postgres → GraphQL/REST APIs
- Frontend: React + TypeScript using the GraphQL API and wallet adapters

## Key Ideas

- Virtual amounts with growing indices for gas‑efficient interest accrual
- Isolation Mode to contain riskier collateral with caps
- Oracle smoothing and validation to reduce manipulation and noise

## Integrating

- Query raw contract state with CosmJS where needed
- Use the GraphQL API for enriched portfolio/market data

Next: see GraphQL API for real queries and endpoints, and the backend Architecture page for system details.
