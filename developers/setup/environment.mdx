# Development Environment Setup

Creda has three repos: contracts (CosmWasm), backend (NestJS indexer + APIs), and frontend (React). Below is the shortest path to get productive.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+, pnpm, yarn
- Rust toolchain + `wasm32-unknown-unknown`
- Postgres, Redis, Docker (optional for optimized builds)

## Repos

```
creda-contracts/   # CosmWasm smart contracts
creda-backend/     # NestJS indexer + GraphQL/REST
creda-frontend/    # React + TypeScript app
```

## Quick Setup

Contracts:
```
git clone https://github.com/credafinance/creda-contracts
cd creda-contracts && cargo test
```

Backend:
```
git clone https://github.com/credafinance/creda-backend
cd creda-backend && yarn && cp .env.example .env && yarn prisma migrate dev && yarn dev
```

Frontend:
```
git clone https://github.com/credafinance/creda-frontend
cd creda-frontend && pnpm i && pnpm dev
```

## Tips

- Ensure Postgres/Redis are running before starting the backend
- Use `.env.example` as a baseline for local config
- Prefer GraphQL queries for frontend data needs

If you hit environment issues, check versions first, then run with clean installs. For deeper details, see each repo’s README.
